# Flashcards Project by C# Academy

## Project Overview

This project allows users to create and manage stacks of flashcards for studying. It includes features for creating, organizing, and reviewing flashcards, as well as tracking study sessions.

## Project Requirements

- Users can create stacks of flashcards.

- Two database tables are required: one for stacks and another for flashcards, linked via a foreign key.

- Stacks must have unique names.

- Every flashcard must belong to a stack. Deleting a stack should also delete its associated flashcards.

- Use DTOs to display flashcards without exposing the stack ID.

- Flashcard IDs within a stack should always be sequential, starting from 1. If a flashcard is deleted, IDs should be restructured accordingly.

- Implement a "Study Session" feature where users can review flashcards. Study sessions should be recorded with a timestamp and score.

- Study sessions should be linked to stacks. If a stack is deleted, its study sessions should also be removed.

- Users should be able to view their study history. Study session records should only allow insert operationsâ€”no updates or deletions.

## Additional Challenges

- Implement a reporting system to display:

  - The number of study sessions per month, per stack.

  - The average score per month, per stack.

- Create an autofill function that loads default data from a JSON file into the database if required tables do not exist.

## Lessons Learned

**1. Database Setup & SQL Exploration:**

  - Installed SQL Server and SSMS, explored SQL operations.

  - Initialized LocalDB for development and tested CRUD operations.

  - Used SSMS throughout the project to validate SQL queries before implementation.

**2. Project Initialization & Design:**

  - Started with a blank project and connected it to SQL Server.

  - Found minimal differences between SQL Server and SQLite in basic operations.

  - Sketched a rough design of classes and models before coding, which evolved over time but reinforced the importance of planning before implementation.

**3. Feature Implementation:**

  - Developed repositories and services for stacks, flashcards, and study sessions.

  - This served as a refresher on database handling after working on a non-SQL-based project.

**4. AutoFill Functionality:**

  - Implemented an autofill feature using a JSON file to store default data.

  - While not the most efficient method, it provided a valuable learning experience in JSON serialization and deserialization.

**5. SQL Query Optimization & Pivoting:**

  - Faced challenges when implementing the reporting system, particularly with SQL table pivoting.

  - Learned to nest SQL queries, an essential skill for advanced data manipulation.

## Areas for Improvement

The project structure feels well-organized, but further refinements may be needed as I gain more experience.
